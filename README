README

nekostring is an emulation of a 70s-era string ensemble.  It has four
oscillators per voice ("Bass", "Cello", "Viola" and "Violin"), and a chorus
ensemble effect to thicken up the sound.  It's not based on a Solina even a little bit.

This version is about as early as it gets and still can be called working.
The code is heavily based on Xsynth-DSSI, and you can see a lot of redundant
code for that in here.  The GUI doesn't work at all.  The code does not build
cleanly.

In order to adjust the sounds, you will need to use dssi_osc_send or similar.
The only values that can be adjusted at the moment are:

3: Cello level (0-1)
4: Viola level (0-1)
5: Violin level (0-1)

10: Attack time (0-1, 0 being slowest)
11: Decay time (0-1, 0 being slowest)

14: Volume (0-1)
15: Tuning (420-460 Hz)

To use nekostring, you need some sort of DSSI host.  I use jack-dssi-host.
What you want is something like "jack-dssi-host nekostring.so" - the GUI should appear and you should be able to start sending stuff to its midi port.

The first release will at least have the Ensemble effect controllable over DSSI.

This plugin is derived from Sean Bolton's Xsynth-DSSI, which in turn contains
code from S. J. Brookes' Xsynth.  Parts of the oscillator code come from Fons
Adriaensen's VCO-Plugins, by way of Xsynth-DSSI.  Parts of the DSSI handling
code may have come from Fluidsynth, again via Xsynth-DSSI.  The chorus/ensemble
plugin began life as part of Giant Flange by Steve W. Harris, but has changed
almost out of all recognition.  These programs are licenced under the GPL,
